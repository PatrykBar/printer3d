Main reason why i create this project was i would like to use this web app not only create it for the idea itself.
Now the application uses the data that is generated, 
but in the future the database will be supplemented with data from the 3D printer and dry box.

If You would like to open this project please just start docker-compose with command like below.
(You have to be inside docker file)

"docker-compose up"
